## Project Overview:

NoteblockStudio4j is a format reader for the Open Source external Minecraft Noteblock editor **Noteblock
Studio Version 3.8** *(Supporting file format 4)*. It's designed to be used as a library by Java programs
and plugins to interpret its file format and to make the developer's job easier! 

Furthermore, the extra NSB4J **Live** component is designed to provide a simple yet powerful api for
playing songs, no matter which platform it's aimed for, with a few simple tweaks. A Bukkit/Spigot version
should be available soonTM and perhaps a Sponge version too.
